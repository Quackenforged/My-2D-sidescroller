# Overview



I have written the code for the infrastructure of a 2 Dimensional Side Scroller game.
This includes an FPS meter and methods of adding colors and shapes to the GUI
I have not yet added the basics for the game, but will next be working on adding sprites and images, as well as user input.

My intent was to gain an understanding of how to code in Java and how to do this from a game creation standpoint

# Development Environment

Mostly just IntelliJ.

I used Java exclusively, and in java I used the libraries "javax.swing", "java.awt", and "java.awt.image.BufferStrategy"
